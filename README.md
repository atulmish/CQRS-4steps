# CQRS-4steps

This is a source code for a CQRS blogpost series describes at my blog:
* [CQRS in 4 steps - Lightning talk](http://radblog.pl/2017/09/17/cqrs-in-4-steps-lightning-talk/)
* [CQRS – First step – Split to commands and queries](http://radblog.pl/2017/08/19/cqrs-first-step-split-to-commands-and-queries/)
* [CQRS – Second step – Simple read model](http://radblog.pl/2017/10/31/cqrs-second-step-different-query-model/)
* [CQRS – Third step – Synchronous read model](http://radblog.pl/en/2018/01/08/cqrs-third-step-synchronous-read-model/)

Currently, source code is completed only for third step.
